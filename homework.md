Accessing Elements:

What does getElementsByClassName("button") do? Why do we store it in buttonList?
What does querySelector(".result") do? What element is this selecting?
Why do we initialize reset to false? What is its purpose?
Adding Event Listeners to Buttons:

What does the loop (starting at line 9) do? Why do we add an event listener to each button?
What happens when a button is clicked and reset is true? Describe the steps inside this condition.
What does the button.textContent property do?
Handling the Equals Button:

What does the event listener for the equals button do? Describe each step inside this event listener.
Why do we check if the input field is empty (currentValue.length == 0)?
Why do we replace "ร" with "*" and "รท" with "/"?
What does the eval function do? Why is it important to handle the result correctly?
What does setting reset to true achieve after evaluating the expression?
Clearing the Input Field:

What does the event listener for the clear button do? Describe the steps.
Why is it important to clear the input field?
Implementing Backspace Functionality:

What does the event listener for the back button do? Describe the steps inside this event listener.
How does the substring method work in this context?
Handling Operator Buttons:

What does the loop (starting at line 53) do? Why do we add an event listener to each operator button?
Why do we check if the input field is empty and the button is not "-"?
Why do we check if the last character is an operator? What are the possible operator characters?
What happens when an operator button is clicked and the last character is not an operator?
Testing and Extending Functionality:

How can you test the calculator to ensure each button works as expected?
If the calculator does not perform as expected, what steps can you take to debug and fix the issues?
How would you add more functionality, such as handling decimal points or additional operators?
How can you refactor the code to make it more modular and maintainable?
